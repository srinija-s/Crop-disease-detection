# Crop-disease-detection
The human population is growing at a very rapid scale. With this progressive growth, it is extremely important to ensure that healthy food is available for the survival of the inhabitants of this planet. Also, the economy of developing countries is highly dependent on agricultural production. The overall economic balance gets affected if there is a variance in the demand and supply of food or agricultural products.
Plant diseases are a great threat to crop yield, causing famines and the economy to slow down. This project focuses on applying a machine learning model for classifying tomato disease image datasets to proactively take necessary steps to combat such an agricultural crisis. The extracted data are fed into a deep neural network for the classification of tomato diseases. The proposed model is then evaluated with the classical machine learning techniques to establish superiority in terms of accuracy and loss rate metrics.
